  <p class="app-main-profile__about">
    Paul Klee's attitude to animals was a matter of surprise to his
    contemporaries. From childhood on he kept a cat, and, as this was known,
    nobody was surprised at his man variations on this theme. This wondrous
    goldfish is in deep blue water, other little red and purple fishes rather
    keeping out of his majesty's way.
